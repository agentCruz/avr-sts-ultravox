This repository showcases the integration between **Agent Voice Response** and **Ultravox's Real-time Speech-to-Speech API**. The application leverages Ultravox's powerful language model to process audio input from users, providing intelligent, context-aware responses in real-time audio format.

## Prerequisites

To set up and run this project, you will need:

1. **Node.js** and **npm** installed
2. An **Ultravox API key** with access to the real-time API
3. **WebSocket** support in your environment

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agentvoiceresponse/avr-sts-ultravox.git
cd avr-sts-ultravox
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project to store your API keys and configuration. You will need to add the following variables:

```bash
ULTRAVOX_API_KEY=your_ultravox_api_key
ULTRAVOX_AGENT_ID=your_ultravox_agent_id
PORT=6031
```

Replace `your_ultravox_api_key` with your actual Ultravox API key.

### 4. Running the Application

Start the application by running the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

The server will start on the port defined in the environment variable (default: 6030).

## How It Works

The **Agent Voice Response** system integrates with Ultravox's Real-time Speech-to-Speech API to provide intelligent audio-based responses to user queries. The server receives audio input from users, forwards it to Ultravox's API, and then returns the model's response as audio in real-time using WebSocket communication.

### Key Components

- **Express.js Server**: Handles incoming audio streams from clients
- **WebSocket Communication**: Manages real-time communication with Ultravox's API
- **Audio Processing**: Handles audio format conversion between 8kHz and 24kHz
- **Real-time Streaming**: Processes and streams audio data in real-time

### Audio Processing

The application includes two main audio processing functions:

1. **Upsampling (8kHz to 24kHz)**:
   - Converts client audio from 8kHz to 24kHz using linear interpolation
   - Required for Ultravox's API which expects 24kHz input

2. **Downsampling (24kHz to 8kHz)**:
   - Converts Ultravox's 24kHz output back to 8kHz
   - Ensures compatibility with client audio systems

## API Endpoints

### POST `/speech-to-speech-stream`

This endpoint accepts an audio stream and returns a streamed audio response generated by Ultravox.

## Customizing the Application

### Environment Variables

You can customize the application behavior using the following environment variables:

- `ULTRAVOX_API_KEY`: Your Ultravox API key (required)
- `ULTRAVOX_AGENT_ID`: Your Ultravox Agent ID (required)
- `PORT`: The port on which the server will listen (default: 6030)

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling for:
- WebSocket connection issues
- Audio processing errors
- Ultravox API errors
- Stream processing errors

All errors are logged to the console and appropriate error messages are returned to the client.
